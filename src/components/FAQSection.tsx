      question: "How do I buy tokenized room nights?",

      answer: "Simply resell the tokens in our marketplace or use them on different dates if flexible tokens are available."
    },
    {
      question: "Are these tokens secure and legal?",
      answer: "We partner with licensed entities and follow regulatory guidelines to ensure transparency and security for all participants."
    },

    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to know blockchain tech to use this?",
